# Unsupervised:  Recommendation-System

# Project Information:
Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with over 209 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films. In thsi project, we have a data related to the movies/shows that are streamed on Netflix. But we didn't have any information about users or their choices. So, we analysed the features and used the available data to cluster similar items rather than making personalised recommendations.

# Problem Statement:
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

## In this  project, you are required to do
1. Exploratory Data Analysis 

2. Understanding what type content is available in different countries

3. Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.

4. Clustering similar content by matching text-based features


# Project Overview:
1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

2. Data Exploration

3. Recommendations on based of the country

4. Preprocessing the data - TF/IDF vectorizer

5. Nearest Neighbors(Model-1)

6. Spectral Clustering (Model -2)

7. Conclusion
